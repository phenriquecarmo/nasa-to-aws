# üõ∞Ô∏è NASA Image of the Day - Project Overview

This project automates the retrieval, processing, and distribution of NASA's Image of the Day using AWS services, a custom API, and a CI/CD pipeline. The architecture is designed for scalability, reliability, and maintainability using Terraform, AWS Lambda, and modern development practices.

This project is an AWS Showcase to Practice AWS Development Skills and CI/CD creation and integration

### üí° Step-By-Step

1. **EC2 Instance / API**  
   A Kotlin-based API hosted on an EC2 instance, we can make a POST Request so that it sends NASA Image of the Day (Retrieved from Nasa's API) to all the emails whose subscription are on SES Service


2. **Secrets Manager**  
   There its managed NASA's API KEY, used to Retrieve the IOTD (Image of The Day)


3. **SNS (Simple Notification Service)**  
   As the POST Request Proceeds, the message containing Nasa's API Content is published to an SNS topic.


4. **SQS (Simple Queue Service)**  
   The message from SNS goes to an SQS queue and then is sent to the first Lambda


5. **First Lambda (Image Downloader)**
    - Triggered by SQS
    - Downloads the image using the provided URL on the upcoming message
    - Then it uploads the image to an S3 bucket


6. **S3 (Simple Storage Service)**  
   Stores the NASA image, and sends IMAGE to SNS using upload events


7. **SNS**
   - Receives data sent from S3 upload events
   - Sends the messages coming from S3 to the destination (Lambda)


8. **Second Lambda #2 (Notifier)**
    - Triggered by SNS
    - Reads the image metadata and builds a custom message (So it can send in a very customized way, SES email templates are not really friendly for intense modifications)
    - Downloads the image to temporary Lambda storage (/tmp).
    - Sends the email to a recipient specified in the environments using Amazon SES with the image attached and a nicely formatted body.


9. **SES (Simple Email Service)**
   - Delivers the email to the recipient (SES_RECIPIENT_EMAIL), including The picture, the custom subject and body text


10. **CI/CD & Terraform**  
   The entire infrastructure is managed using Terraform (*IaC*), including backend state storage in S3. GitHub and CI/CD pipeline are used to ensure consistent deployment.
